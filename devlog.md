DEVLOG: A Not So Dark Game

[3/10/19] - Created devlog approximately one week after starting game.  So far:
-Title Screen Created
-Map Created
-Location 1 Finished
-Location 2 In Progress
-Application (C#) Created
In the next week, I hope to accomplish:
-Finish Location 2
-Start Location 3
-Come up with something more challenging than a reaction test

[3/11/19] - Started day by fixing some problems with the "Invalid Input" notifier.
Overall:
-Mainly spent the day debugging
-Debugged invalid input (would tell you input was invalid and then bring you to main options)
-Debugged items list (would show you items and then bring you back to main options without input)
-Neatened up some code

[3/12/19] - Created GitHub page for development documentation.
-Dev Build 1 finished.  Features one location.  Is more of a proof of concept than anything.
-Started location 2, features a lot more paths and
