DEVLOG: A Not So Dark Game

[3/10/19] - Created devlog approximately one week after starting game.  So far:
-Title Screen Created
-Map Created
-Location 1 Finished
-Location 2 In Progress
-Application (C#) Created
In the next week, I hope to accomplish:
-Finish Location 2
-Start Location 3
-Come up with something more challenging than a reaction test

[3/11/19] - Started day by fixing some problems with the "Invalid Input" notifier.
Overall:
-Mainly spent the day debugging
-Debugged invalid input (would tell you input was invalid and then bring you to main options)
-Debugged items list (would show you items and then bring you back to main options without input)
-Neatened up some code

[3/12/19] - Created GitHub page for development documentation.
-Dev Build 1.0 finished.  Features one location.  Is more of a proof of concept than anything.
-Started location 2, features a lot more paths and options

[3/13/19] - Goals for today:
-Create all dialogue options for axeman
-Release Dev Build 1.02?

[3/14/19] - Definitely not releasing Dev Build 2 until next week
-Worked on location two some more
-Dialogue and such

[3/19/19] - Was a little busy but got a good amount of work done on location 2, should be finished soon so I can release Dev Build 2


[3/20/19] - Releasing Debug for Dev Build 2 Before I release it
