# A-Not-So-Dark-Game
A small command-prompt game project I work on in my free time, primarily to be seen by my friends.

Currently in development stage.  This page is more or less being created just so that my friends who try it have an easier way of getting the latest build.  I'm not here for collaborators, or to distribute anything.

A new build will be released weekly, at the very least.

# Compatibility
JRE 1.8.0_201 is currently required to run.

Compatible with Windows XP, 7, and 10.

# How To Run
Press "Clone or Download" on project page

Run the application "A Not So Dark Game"

NOTE: Don't move the application or it won't run properly
