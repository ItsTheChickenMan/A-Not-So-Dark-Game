# A-Not-So-Dark-Game
A small command-prompt game project I work on in my free time, primarily to be seen by my friends.

Currently in Alpha stage.  This page is more or less being created just so that my friends who try it have an easier way of getting the latest build.  I'm not here for collaborators, or to distribute anything.

A new build will be released weekly, at the very least.
