# A-Not-So-Dark-Game
A small command-prompt game project I work on in my free time, primarily to be seen by my friends.

Currently in development stage.  This page is more or less being created just so that my friends who try it have an easier way of getting the latest build.  I'm not here for collaborators, or to distribute anything.

A new build will be released weekly, at the very least.

# CURRENT BUILD
You are playing the latest version, which is probably buggy but features more stuff.  If you find bugs, report them, please, so I can fix them ASAP.

Dev Build 1.0 (latest functioning version) is available via download at the releases page.  It features one location.

# Compatibility
JRE 1.8.0_201 is currently required to run.  You can download it here: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html

Compatible with Windows XP, 7, and 10.

# How To Run
