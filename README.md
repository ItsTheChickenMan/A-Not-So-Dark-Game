# A-Not-So-Dark-Game
A small command-prompt game project I work on in my free time.

Currently in development stage.  The github page is more or less being created just so that I can document my progress, and so that if anyone I know asks to try it they can get the latest build.  I'm not here for collaborators, or to distribute anything publicly.

A new build will be released monthy, at the very least.

# CURRENT BUILD
You are playing the latest version, which is probably buggy but features more stuff.  If you find bugs, report them, please, so I can fix them ASAP.

Dev Build 1.0 (latest functioning version) is available via download at the releases page.  It features one location.

# Compatibility
JRE 1.8.0_201 is currently required to run.  You can download it here: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html

Compatible with Windows XP, 7, and 10.

# How To Run
Run the application "A Not So Dark Game"

NOTE: Don't move the application or it won't run properly
